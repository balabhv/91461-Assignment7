            <h1>About Shiba Tatsuya (The One True Tatsuya Stu)</h1>
            <div id='main'>
                Shiba Tatsuya (司波 達也) is the main protagonist of 
                <q>The Irregular in Magic High School</q> light novel and animated series. 
                He enrolled at the National Magic University Affiliated First High School in 
                April 2095 with his younger sister, Miyuki (深雪).He got accepted as one of the 
                students to be placed in the Course 2 curriculum, marking the start of both the 
                light novel's and anime's series of events. In his second year, he transferred 
                into the newly made Magic Engineering Course.

            <div id='appearance'>
                <h2>Appearance and Personality</h2>
                <p>Tatsuya is 175cm tall (178cm in Volume 3), well-built and often described as mundane-looking compared to other characters in the series. Based on the light novel, he also was described through other characters' impressions as cute or competent-looking.</p>

                <p>He is usually expressionless and very rarely does he get surprised or enthusiastic, and whenever he does, however, it's often at the minimum level. In the anime, he has dark hair that reaches his clear blue eyes in several uneven cut bangs- he shares both his hair and eye color with his sister Miyuki.</p>

                <p>Tatsuya is normally wearing his green, white, and black school uniform, lacking the eight-petaled flower emblem on his blazer during his first year. At home, he generally wears a nondescript black shirt and pants.</p>

                <p>Tatsuya is intelligent and analytical. His emotions are merely skewed in a certain direction, with one particular half becoming especially sensitive. Thanks to this, he can easily and quickly categorize people into two distinctive groups: hostile and non-hostile (while normal people would see 3 types: hostile, neutral and friendly. They would have a hard time to know who is a friend and who is an enemy since they aren't sensitive). This certainly comes in handy for his military and political life and anything related to conflicts (which is almost everything in life).</p>
                <p>He doesn't possess the ability to hate nor could he feel any strong emotions like fury, despair, envy, hatred, disgust, gluttony, lust, sloth, and love.</p>
                <p>The only aspect in him that is perfectly natural — the only emotion that remains — is his love for his sister. Because of this, he tends to either spoil her too much, or be overprotective and completely ruthless when there are threats towards Miyuki's safety. For him, his world revolves around Miyuki and he loves her dearly. In the eyes of their friends, Tatsuya exhibits blatant favoritism towards his sister, and hence is called a <span>siscon</span>.</p>
                <p>Though contrary to his own belief, Tatsuya does have a faint degree of emotions and can be kind and caring towards his friends, though he is often irritated by some of them as well. While he cannot feel lust, he still can acknowledge and notices other girls' charms throughout the series. He also worries about his reputation and has some pride though he doesn't seek to attract attention.</p>
                <p>Due to being treated like a fake magician, he always underestimates his own magic abilities and constantly looks down on himself, having difficulty accepting praise and grasping the meaning beneath indirect words of flirting. He actually does have a bit of an inferiority complex especially about ordinary things that others own or can handle well.</p>
                <p>He also has what his friends call, an 'unexpected flaw', for being quite slow in fathoming others' goodwill or attractions towards him as he, as explained by Miyuki's point of view, can only interpret them by logical explanation and often questioning why people would think positively of himself. </p>
                <p>In a nutshell, his lack of understanding and experiences in emotions except for his sister, caused lots of misunderstanding in his interaction with others. Because Tatsuya has no memories of other feelings since childhood, he does not know how to respond to people when they are sending him their emotions, praises for his personalities or anything regarding himself. This leads to him feeling awkward, astonished, clueless on how to reply, or redden. Usually, he still can deal with the praises sent to his achievements but when it comes to anything about his personalities, he will have an inner turmoil of answering them and sometimes will just ignore them if he has the chance.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Tatsuya is the eldest son of Shiba Tatsurou and Shiba Miya and is eleven months older than his younger and only sibling Miyuki (his birthday falls on April 24th). They are often mistaken as twins for being in the same year.</p>
                <p>Prior to the timeline at the beginning of the series, their father remarried six months after their mother's death, and the two of them are living alone in a house, which is described as a place that vastly exceeds the average size.</p>
                <p>Since he was young, one of the only things in which he shows enthusiasm-like qualities, is in Magic Engineering and CAD developments. He has an aptitude for them and has continually displayed his interest until now, as he is aided by the circumstances. Their house has a basement with the same floor layout as the floor above, redecorated as Tatsuya's lab equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and plentiful area for where new types of magic created by Tatsuya are tested, and for research or other purposes. </p>
